# Explainable Hangman

## Overview
Explainable Hangman is a behavior-aware word guessing game developed in Python.  
Unlike traditional Hangman games, this project introduces explainability and basic psychological analysis, transforming a classic game into an intelligent and educational experience.

The game not only determines win or loss but also analyzes how the player approaches guessing.

## Key Features
- Console-based Hangman game with a simple stick-man drawing  
- Randomized word selection for fair gameplay  
- Separate tracking of correct and incorrect guesses  
- Explainable game analysis report after completion  
- Psychological guessing pattern detection:
  - Vowel-focused guessing
  - Consonant-focused guessing
  - Balanced guessing strategy  
- Clean, exam-ready and professional code structure

## What Makes This Project Unique
Most Hangman implementations stop at gameplay.  
This project goes further by analyzing player behavior and generating an explainable summary of how the game was played.

It applies the concept of explainable systems to a simple word game, making it transparent, thoughtful, and learning-oriented.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Standard Python library: `random`  
- Console input/output  

No external dependencies are required.

---

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system  
2. Clone or download this repository  
3. Run the program using:
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game

## Game Analysis Output
At the end of each game, the program displays:
- Total guesses made  
- Number of correct guesses  
- Number of wrong guesses  
- Identified guessing style (vowel-focused, consonant-focused, or balanced)

## Educational Value
This project demonstrates:
- Control flow and loops  
- String and list operations  
- Input validation  
- Game state management  
- Basic behavioral analysis  
- Explainable output generation  

It is suitable for academic submissions, practical exams, and beginner-level project portfolios.
